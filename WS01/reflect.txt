Answer2 : SSH  is an application through which we can share files between 2 computers securely. As I have MacBook , and there is an   in-built ssh appllication in MacBook name “terminal”. So I used it. For using ssh , first I connected my MacBook to global protect vpn and then logged into my matrix account using Seneca username and password. After that, I created 2 folders to save my coding program using SFTP application and then compiled and ran my program successfully in it . And at last , submitted my program to professor using terminal.

Answer 1 : Whenever we print a  floating type number, our complier tries to give output as precise as possible. However , whenever a compiler runs a  code with so much point numbers (like in our case 15) during calculation it's storage of 32 bit complete. and with that half calculation , it have to print the most precise number which is almost very close to the exact number.

Answer 2: #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS

#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    float a = 20.00;

    int b ; b = (float)a;

    int c = b/2;

    float d ; d = a - (c*2);

    printf("Coin     Qty   Balance\n");

    printf("-------- --- ---------\n");

    printf("                %.2f\n",a);

    printf("Toonies  %d    %.4f\n",c,d);

    int e ; e = d/(b%2);

    printf("Loonies   %d    %.4f\n",e,d);

    printf("Quarters  %d    %.4f\n",e,d);

    printf("Dimes     %d    %.4f\n",e,d);

    printf("Nickels   %d    %.4f\n",e,d);

    printf("Pennies   %d    %.4f\n",e,d);

    return 0;

}
